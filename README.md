# Disability Progression in Multiple Sclerosis
This repository is a collection of tools for assessing disability progression in Multiple Sclerosis based on changes in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores over time.

## Contents
* Functions for data preprocessing and follow-up identification
* Functions for assigning the corresponding baseline (fixed study baseline or roving reference) to each assessment in a series
* Functions for annotating first progression events
* Functions for the analysis of time to first progression
